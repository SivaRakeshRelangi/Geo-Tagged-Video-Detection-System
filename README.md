# Video-Detection-System
- You can change and give desired Fps rate and Epochs just change the values as shown in the Image below.

## üìö Dependencies

- Python 3.12+
- OpenCV (opencv-python
- Tesseract (pytesseract)
- PyTorch (torch, torchvision)
- Ultralytics (ultralytics)
- Others: pandas, tqdm, matplotlib, pillow

- ![fpsandepochsettingshere](projectFilesCreated.png)

This project extracts frames from a video at a configurable rate, performs **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** using **Tesseract**, and applies **YOLOv8** object detection on the original video. Outputs include extracted frames, OCR metadata, and an annotated video with object detections.


---
## üìå Notes
- Ensure your video is in a supported format (e.g., .mp4)
- OCR quality depends on video resolution and clarity
- Tesseract must be installed via apt for Colab environments
- YOLOv8 can run on CPU, but GPU is recommended for speed
- 
## üöÄ ## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Extract frames at a fixed interval (e.g., every 0.5 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Apply OCR using Tesseract on each frame
 
   - Tries **3 preprocessing routes**:  
     - Otsu threshold on grayscale  
     - Morphological open/close  
     - White-on-blue HSV mask + Otsu  
   - Extracts LAT/LON (if present) + saves raw OCR text.  
- ‚úÖ Save OCR + timestamp info to a CSV file
- ‚úÖ Perform YOLOv8 object detection on the full video
- ‚úÖ Output annotated video with bounding boxes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup (Google Colab)
1. Open the provided notebook:  
   `object_video_detection.ipynb`
2. Upload your video to Colab and set `VIDEO_PATH`.  
3. Run cells sequentially:

## üõ† Troubleshooting
- **OCR Issues**:  
  - Banner text may blur due to compression or motion.  
  - Use HSV mask route for better extraction of **white on blue**.
  - - ![Ocrpytessaracttext](Ocrpytessaracttext.png)
  - Raw OCR is stored in `metadata.csv` for debugging.  

- **Motion Labels Mismatched**:  
  - Shadows or UI elements can be misclassified as motion.
